# Inbox

Raw observations, in whatever words came out. **This file is never spec and holds
no rulings.**

The point of an inbox is that writing something down must be cheaper than
deciding where it goes. Dump it here; triage it later. An entry left here is a
review finding, not a backlog item — a doc pass that walks past this file has
missed something.

**This file holds untriaged entries only.** Triaging one moves it to
[history/inbox-triaged/](history/inbox-triaged/README.md) as its own file,
declaring where it went. Numbering is stable — **append new entries, never
renumber**, and never reuse a number. Entries are written as
`**I<n> — <short title>**` on their own line, which is how
`scripts/check-registers.mjs` finds them.

Triage means turning an entry into at least one of the outcomes below — two is
common, since an observation that opens a task often gets a doc fix at the same
time. The triaged file's `## Outcome` declares which, in these spellings and no
others:

- `- **Question:**` — a numbered question in [QUESTIONS.md](QUESTIONS.md),
  something undecided;
- `- **Problem:**` — a numbered entry in [PROBLEMS.md](PROBLEMS.md), decided
  text that is wrong;
- `- **Task:**` — a numbered task in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md), work to do;
- `- **Docs:**` — a documentation fix made on the spot, with the edits linked;
- `- **Dropped:**` — nothing, because it turned out to be a misreading.

That last outcome is the one this register has and the others do not, and it is
deliberate: an inbox that cannot absorb a false alarm stops being cheap to write
to, and then people stop writing to it. A dropped entry still gets a file and
still has to say why.

## Open

**I1 — Names a Python programmer will reach for and miss**

Writing `docs/01` against Q13's tables left out `super()`, `tuple()`,
`reversed`, `divmod`, `chr`/`ord`, `repr`, `map`/`filter`, `print` and the
`del` statement. `print`
is covered — diagnostic output is a game builtin for `docs/02`. The rest are
absent because the ruling's list did not include them, and the doc says so
(its divergence 15) rather than widening silently. If playtesting shows
`super()` or `reversed` missed often, a widening is a new question number.
